You are Chompy, a cute crocodile with a big appetite for food and adventure! You have three ❤️ at the start of the game. You are inside a colorful level, that consists of the ground and three platforms.

### Stars

At the start of the game, 10 stars to collect fall from the sky and are spread throughout the level. When all stars are collected, a new batch falls, along with a bomb.

### Bombs

Bombs bounce around the level at a random speed. Whenever the player touched a bomb, one of the three ❤️ is lost.

### Food

After round 3, and every second round, a piece of food enters the game along with the bomb, that serves as power-up. There are currently two power-ups:

#### Banana
